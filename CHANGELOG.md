## [1.0.0] - 25-06-2025

### Added
- **Code organization and maintainability improvements**: Major refactoring to improve code structure and constants management
  - Created centralized constants package (`internal/constants/`) for all hardcoded values
  - Added `defaults.go` with numeric constants, timeouts, size limits, and conversion factors
  - Added `mime_types.go` with MIME type mappings, file extensions, and content type detection
  - Added `queries.go` with all SQL queries as named constants for better maintainability
  - Moved default file type arrays to constants for configuration validation

### Changed
- **SQL query organization**: Extracted all inline SQL queries from `database.go` into named constants
  - Improved code readability by removing large SQL blocks from functions
  - Enhanced maintainability with centralized query management
  - Consistent naming convention for all database queries
- **Constants consolidation**: Moved all magic numbers and hardcoded strings to centralized constants
  - Eliminated hardcoded timeout values (30 seconds, 1024*1024 bytes, etc.)
  - Centralized MIME type mappings and file extension handling
  - Moved default media type configurations to constants
- **Code quality improvements**: Removed debugging messages that were used for troubleshooting specific issues
  - Cleaned up production code by removing temporary debug logging
  - Preserved functional logging while removing troubleshooting artifacts

### Technical Debt Reduction
- **Breaking changes**: This is a major version bump due to significant internal restructuring
- **Improved maintainability**: All configuration values, SQL queries, and constants are now centrally managed
- **Enhanced developer experience**: Easier to modify timeouts, limits, and queries without hunting through code
- **Better testing**: Constants can be easily adjusted for testing scenarios

## [0.54.0] - 24-06-2025

### Added
- **Message deletion forwarding**: When a message is deleted in Signal, it is now automatically deleted in WhatsApp
  - Real-time deletion event detection from Signal CLI REST API
  - Proper handling of Signal `remoteDelete` events in message processing
  - Database lookup by Signal message ID for accurate message mapping
  - WAHA API integration for WhatsApp message deletion using correct message ID format

### Fixed
- **WAHA API response parsing**: Fixed critical issue where WhatsApp message IDs were not being extracted properly
  - Updated response parsing to handle actual WAHA API format with nested `_serialized` field
  - Added support for both `id._serialized` and `_data.id._serialized` response structures
  - Proper extraction of WhatsApp message IDs in format `true_chatId@c.us_messageId`
  - Fixed empty message ID issue that prevented message deletion from working
- **Signal deletion event detection**: Enhanced Signal CLI message processing to detect `remoteDelete` events
  - Added `RemoteDelete` field to Signal REST message structure
  - Proper parsing of deletion timestamps and target message identification
  - Improved message filtering to process deletion events correctly

### Changed
- **Database queries**: Updated message deletion lookup to use `GetMessageMappingBySignalID` instead of generic mapping lookup
- **Response structures**: Added `WAHAMessageResponse` type to properly handle complex WAHA API responses
- **Error messages**: Improved validation and error reporting for message deletion operations

## [0.53.0] - 24-06-2025

### Added
- **Signal voice recording detection**: Automatic detection of voice recordings without file extensions
  - File signature detection using binary headers (OGG "OggS" signature detection)
  - Content-based file type detection when file extensions are missing
  - Proper routing of Signal voice recordings to WhatsApp `/api/sendVoice` endpoint
- **Auto-reply to last sender**: When responding without quoting a message, automatically replies to the most recent WhatsApp contact
  - Database query optimization for finding latest message mappings
  - Eliminates "New thread creation is not yet supported" warnings for natural conversation flow
  - Maintains conversation context across multiple WhatsApp contacts
- **Message reactions forwarding**: Signal reactions (üëç, ‚ù§Ô∏è, etc.) are now forwarded to WhatsApp
  - React and remove reactions between platforms
  - Proper message correlation for reaction targeting
  - Full emoji support for reaction forwarding

### Fixed
- **Signal voice recordings without extensions**: Files like `signal-attachments/P59DFxKqtUuf3KdZB2cp` now properly detected as voice messages
  - Fixed "file type . is not allowed" errors for extensionless voice recordings
  - Enhanced media validation to default unknown files to documents instead of rejecting them
  - Improved content detection algorithm with binary file signature recognition
- **Auto-reply logic**: Eliminated incorrect message routing when replying without quotes
  - Fixed database encryption issues in latest message mapping queries
  - Improved message threading for seamless conversation continuation
- **Test coverage**: Enhanced test suite for voice detection and auto-reply functionality

### Changed
- **Media handling**: Unknown file types now default to document processing instead of being rejected
- **Database interface**: Added `GetLatestMessageMapping` method for improved message correlation
- **Error handling**: More graceful fallback behavior for unsupported file types
