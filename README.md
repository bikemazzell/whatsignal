WhatSignal is a bridge service that enables one-to-one chat between WhatsApp and Signal. It forwards messages (text, images, videos, audio, reactions) between the platforms while maintaining conversation context, supporting replies, and providing intelligent auto-reply functionality.

## Features

- WhatsApp ‚Üî Signal one-to-one bridge with preserved context (replies, quotes, metadata)
- Smart contacts: show names (not numbers), warm cache at startup, periodic refresh, graceful fallback
- Media that just works: images, videos, documents, voice notes; config-driven types; binary sniffing; WAHA Plus/Core‚Äëaware routing
- WAHA integration: auto version detection, typing indicators, seen status, session management and recovery
- Message extras: reactions, auto‚Äëreply to last sender, delivery status tracking
- Security by default: encrypted storage, webhook auth/validation, configurable retention, automated cleanup
- Operational hygiene: health endpoint, structured JSON logs, graceful retries
- Developer‚Äëfriendly: Dockerized, type‚Äësafe handling, comprehensive tests (>80% coverage)


## Prerequisite Accounts
To use WhatSignal, you must have:

1. **WhatsApp Number**: Registered and active, activated as a session on WAHA.
2. **Signal Bridge Number**: Dedicated for the bridge, used by Signal-CLI, and different from the destination number.
3. **Signal Destination Number**: The final recipient, typically on your mobile or desktop Signal app. This must not be the same as the bridge number.
